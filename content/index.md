# Home - Cook One Thing

![[img - cookonething.jpg]]

Welcome to this little outpost on the far reaches of the internet. Think of it as being on the outer rim of the solar system in a rich and varied universe of opportunity! If you've found yourself here, then welcome!

When you cook one thing, you're not rushing to fill the plate - you're learning what happens when you give something your complete attention. It's about resisting the urge to juggle ten projects and instead discovering what emerges when you let one idea develop fully, naturally, without distraction. Just like those childhood programming loops on a [[2025-08-03 - Genesis - there be dragons!|Dragon 32]]- one line of code at a time, watching the screen fill with something beautiful.

# ðŸŒ±- What Is This Place?

This site is set up as a [[25-08-03 - Digital Garden|Digital Garden]] - an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where I can share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public.

This digital garden is evergreen: I keep editing and refining notes rather than letting them decay after publication. There's no chronological order here, instead, you'll find a network of interconnected ideas linked together, creating trails you can follow based on your interests.

This garden is here to help me share the evolving seeds of my thinking as I grow with Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), my cooking adventures, and perhaps as I move forward with tiny experiments in AI, data and personal growth. Some paths will be well-trodden and polished, while others might be rougher works-in-progressâ€”much like a real garden with both manicured lawns and wild experimental patches!
