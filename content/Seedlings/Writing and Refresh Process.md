## Part 6: Content Workflow

### Daily Writing Process

1. **Write in Obsidian** (or preferred editor)
2. **Use proper frontmatter** for new posts
3. **Commit when ready:**
    
    ```bash
    git add .git commit -m "New post: Your Post Title"git push
    ```
    
4. **Cloudflare automatically rebuilds** (2-5 minutes)

### Multi-Device Setup

If using OneDrive sync:

- **Install Node.js** on all devices where you want to publish
- **Clone repository** to synced folder on each device
- **Can write on any device**, commit from any device
